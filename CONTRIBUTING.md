# UnityRO
## How to contribute?

At this moment we're still under a heavy amount of initial work, however we try to follow the Git-Flow pattern where
* `master` is a point of release once `develop` reach a milestone
* `develop` is where all PRs get merged
* `bug/*` or `feature/*` for branches diverging from `develop`

We would also like to encourage the usage of [Issues](https://github.com/guilhermelhr/unityro/issues) and of [Projects](https://github.com/guilhermelhr/unityro/projects/1) so we can have a better sigthseeing of the current state of work.
 
### Branch Naming
As for the branch naming, we encourage of having every branch linked to a specific issue following the pattern:

`feature/<issue number>_<very brief description>` eg: `feature/32_update-packets-to-2020`
