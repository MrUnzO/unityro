## Motivation

### Why this instead of contributing to roBrowser or any other?

We at UnityRO recognize the power WebGL has over a "Jack of all trades" solution like Unity. However, it is a stable multi-platform solution with lots of plug and play features, specially physics (not that RO has much), which makes things much easier to handle, maintain and future-proof.
